During the semester we will design your first software (no coding!). Designing software is a group activity and I will create groups in the class. I will try to make them grouping you depending on your background. Indeed, since you will have to pick your own topic, if you have a similar background you can come out with an idea of a software that can help with the problem you have in your field.

The project will consist of two deliverables, a demo, and a final document. In addition to the official deliverables, you will need to publish weekly updates on your work on the project.

Project Description

Part-time and full-time musicians face many struggles with coordination and availability beyond existing limited social circles. With this software, we want to alleviate the musician’s pains by allowing him/her to connect with other like-minded musicians and form jam sessions that work around his/her lifestyle. This software targets adult musicians of any skill range seeking to coordinate with and meet other musicians for jam sessions. Musicians who are actively looking for others to play with are currently stuck with options such as asking friends and acquaintances or posting ads on social media and at music stores. These choices leave musicians limited to a small circle of those directly around them. Another issue musicians face is the time and effort spent finding someone who plays a particular instrument or a potential band member that fits their desired criteria. It can also be difficult for new locals, beginner instrumentalists, or those who don’t want to commit long term to a group to find other musicians to meet and play with. This software will be able to easily allow musicians to input their information, create sessions with their desired criteria, and look at others’ individual profiles and jam sessions within their preferred distance and location. 

One sentence summary of our project: An app that pairs casual musicians in an area to active jam sessions in a user interface akin to matching with people on a dating app. 

More Detailed Explanation of the Interface: When you first open the app you will start by making an account/profile in which you will provide your name, gender, age, photos of yourself, instruments you play, level of experience, preferred genres and availability. You will then be taken to a screen in which you have two options. You can choose to “create a jam session” or “look for a jam session”. If you create a Session, you set a number of parameters of what type of musicians that can find your session. You can set the levels of experience you want to see, genres, instruments, and proximity of location needed for musicians in your session. After setting those preferences, you, as the owner of the session, will now see musicians in your area that meet those preferences. You can choose whether or not you want them for your session by swiping left or right, much like a dating app. If you choose to want them for your session, and they choose to join your session, they are now added into a Jam Session Group Chat with all of the other musicians that you, as the owner, chose to add to the session that also wanted to join your session. The “Look for a Jam Session” section of the app will be the opposite. You, as a musician looking for a session, will see a number of potential sessions in your area that state what time they are, what type of musicians, genres, and experience they are looking for, and who is already part of the session (including the owner of the session) so you can check out all of the potential jam members and their profiles. You can choose to swipe right to potentially add yourself to the session or swipe left to move onto the next available session. If the owner of the session swipes right on you too, you get thrown into a group chat for all other people interested in the session in order to coordinate when to meet. Other features to mention: On the member profiles, we are looking into also integrating social media connections so people can share their profiles to show off their music or experience via their YouTube, Instagram, Soundcloud, or other profiles. 

Conclusion: We want to connect musicians together much like the garage jam sessions of old, but with a 21st-century influence by providing those connections in an interface many adults are familiar with. By developing this app we will help artists of all styles find people like them who just want to make music, no guitar strings attached! 

Deliverable descriptions

Deliverable  #1

For this deliverable you have to produce a full Product Vision Document that consists of:

Consolidated Vision-in-the-box statement Vision-in-the-box statements 
A set of user personas (not the details)
A set of user stories (not the details)
Your Vision-in-a-box statement shall incorporate the final scope and intent of the project, however, it can concentrate specifically on your team’s ideas (e.g., by selecting to highlight the features your team has proposed).

Deliverable #2

Develop the user stories and personas introduced in deliverable #1 and a UI storyboard. Also, develop a data description document. The document shall contain the information about the data that the application your team is working on shall work with.

The data description document shall contain the following parts:

A brief description (in colloquial English) of the types of data your application needs to properly run. A list of entity categories (entity sets) documented to the best of your ability. For each entity category, it is important to indicate specific attributes it contains, and the attribute or attributes, that, in your opinion form keys.
A list of relationship types (relationship sets) documented to the best of your ability. For each relationship set, start by describing it using the EntitySet actionVerb EntitySet sentence structure (e.g., “Students take course sections”), or is needed using passive voice verbs (e.g., “Products are stored on shelves”).
Specify any additional information you can:
Type of the relationship (many-to-many, many-to-one, one-to-one)
Any attributes associated directly with it.
...
Additionally, for each entity category, and for each relationship category, the developers need to understand their possible origins. The typical origins are:
Available at the outset: data must be collected before the application is deployed.
User-created content:  data is created as part of user interactions with the application.
Automatically-generated data: data is created automatically during the life-time of the application.

Final submission

For the final document, you need to develop a UI prototype (we will partially do it in class/online) and evaluate it against the UI Storyboards and against the user story collection. Building a collection of use cases - (at least) one per user story created. While below we describe these tasks separately, you can perform them together. That is, you can build user stories, as you are evaluating the UI prototype.

Task 1.  Perform both verification and validation of the UI prototype Verification.  Compare the UI prototype to the UI Storyboard you developed in class. If you notice any discrepancies between the UI prototype and the UI Storyboard, you may have discovered a verification issue. Possible verification issues are:
Error of omission: a UI component or interaction present on the UI Storyboard is missing from the prototype.
Error of commission: a UI component or interaction is present in the UI prototype, but not on the UI Storyboard
Error of interpretation: a UI component or interaction appears to behave differently in the UI prototype than the UI Storyboard suggests.
Validation. Compare the UI prototype to the list of user stories that was created by your (combined) team.  You are primarily responsible for validating the user stories that your Section created, but if you notice validation issues with other use stories, you can report them as well. Possible validation issues include:
Error of omission: a user story is not implemented in the UI prototype (that is, you do not see a way to successfully complete a user story with the current UI prototype)
Error of commission: the UI prototype appears to be implementing user stories that are not part of the existing collection.
Error of interpretation: the UI prototype misinterprets the intent of a use story.
Error of usability: the UI prototype appears to implement a user story, but does it in a way that you find inconvenient (and you have suggestions on how to make it more convenient).
Task 2. Create a comprehensive list of use cases. Describe each use case as follows:
Identifier.  Give each use case a unique identifier. E.g., you can id your use cases with labels of the form UC-01, UC-02, and so on.  Disambiguate the ids for both sections - thus a better way to do this is UCS01-01, UCS01-02, for Section 01, and UCS02-01, …, for Section 02. You can build your own Use Case ID template as you see fit.
Title. A short title of the use case. Typically a sentence of the form “Scheduling a trip”, “Adding two numbers”, or “Checking room availability without logging in as a user”. Most of the time, you can use the gerund form of the action verb as the first word in the title.
User Story. Each use case must have a user story associated with it. Copy it from your list of user stories.  Please note, while most user stories are going to be associated with a single use case, it is possible that some user stories will be associated with multiple use cases. Place a copy of the user story in the description of each use case.
Main Success Scenario. We will follow Martin Fowler’s common style for use case structure (it is the simplest one, and still contains everything we really need). The core of Fowler’s use case structure is the main success scenario - the list of steps that happen when the user story is brought to life in the software.
Extensions. Sometimes you may need to show alternate ways of achieving the same goal. In this case, indicate the location in the main success scenario from which the action diverges, and submit a sequence of steps starting that point.
In the final document, you submit includes these results and the content of (revised) deliverables #1 and #2. Your final report shall include the following sections:

Title, names, and email addresses of all team members in your section. The main areas of responsibility for each group member, listing who did what and what percentage of the final project can be attributed to each member
Abstract describing very briefly what is detailed in the report.
Introduction: the revised version of the initial product proposal document. T
Personas: Please provide a curated list of personas. Edit your personas document so that there is an introduction, describing briefly the need for each presented persona. Feel free to omit from the original list any personas that look superfluous, or that do not have independent user stories (see below).  Edit all your personas to follow roughly the same format (if they already don’t).
User Stories: The requirements parts of your report will consist of user stories, use cases, data description, and non-functional requirements sections.  For the User Stories section, please order your stories in a way that creates a clear narrative: user stories addressing the core functionality must be placed first, stories addressing secondary features can follow.  You are responsible only for user stories your section developed. Some user stories may have to be reported on both teams’ reports, but you only need to cover the general functionality and the specific functionality your team is responsible for.
Use Cases: Include translations of your user stories into use cases. Make sure that each use case mentions specific user story it implements (I recommend that you give all your user stories, use cases, and non-functional requirements unique tags, e.g., US01, UC01, NFR01).
Data Description: include the final version of your data description document. I expect the informal part of the data description to be sufficiently informative. The formal part shall contain the lists of entity types (entity sets) with all their attributes, and the relationship types (relationship sets), with any multiplicity (many-to-many, many-to-one, one-to-one) information you can provide.
Non-Functional Requirements: the final section of your formal requirements part is the non-functional requirements.
Lessons Learned. Provide a detailed reflection on the course project. Let us know what you have learned as part of your work on the project, what are the things you wish you have learned better, what were the pain points and frustrations. Identify any things you would have done differently.  I want to see both the general team reflection - jointly co-written by all team members, as well as individual reflections of each team member (although, for obvious reasons, I urge you to keep interpersonal conflicts out of these reflections).
Demo

Prepare a 10-15 minutes video in which you show your prototype and the steps you have done to validate and verify it.

Additional Work

Each group member has to submit a short document (maximum a paragraph per group member) explaining each member's contribution and the quality of that contribution. Also, each student will need to evaluate all the other demo using the following rubric (available here in .pdf and .docx)
